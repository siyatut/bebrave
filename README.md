# bebrave

#### 📝 **Description**

**bebrave** is an app designed to help users build and track their habits efficiently. It allows users to set goals, monitor progress, and analyze results over different time periods. The app leverages Combine for reactive programming, stores data using UserDefaults, and features a well-structured UI with custom cells and smooth animations.

#### 🚀 **Key Features:**

* Add, edit, and delete habits
* Track progress with a segmented progress bar
* Support for different time periods (week, month, half-year, year)
* Habit history with visual statistics
* Responsive UI with swipe gestures and empty state handling

#### 🛠 **Technologies**

* Swift + UIKit
* MVVM + Combine (reactive data binding)
* UserDefaults (data persistence)
* UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout (flexible UI design)
* Animations & Gestures (smooth interactions and UI effects)
* SwiftLint (for static code analysis)  

#### 🔮 **Future Improvements**

* **Habit screen** — working on resolving issues with the emoji that represents the quality of habit completion on specific days to ensure accurate tracking.
* **History sub-screen** — currently under development with a new designer to enhance the visualization of habit-tracking progress.
* **Diary screen** — allow users to write daily reflections and review them later.
* **Profile screen** — include options to contact the developer, personalize user settings, and potentially add habit-tracking statistics.
