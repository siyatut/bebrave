#### 📝 **Description**

bebrave is an app designed to help users build and track their habits efficiently. It allows users to set goals, monitor progress, and analyze results over different time periods. The app leverages Combine for reactive programming, stores data using UserDefaults, and features a well-structured UI with custom cells and smooth animations.

#### 🚀 **Key Features:**

* Add, edit, and delete habits
* Track progress with a segmented progress bar
* Support for different time periods (week, month, half-year, year)
* Habit history with visual statistics
* Responsive UI with swipe gestures and empty state handling

#### 🛠 **Technologies**

* Swift + UIKit
* MVVM + Combine (reactive data binding)
* UserDefaults (data persistence)

#### 🔮 **Future Improvements**

* **Enhanced progress bar visualization** — improve the way the progress bar fills based on the selected time period
* **Diary screen** — allow users to write daily reflections and review them later
* **Profile screen** — include options to contact the developer, personalize user settings, and potentially add habit-tracking statistics
